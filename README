Boot the app

That’s all the setup you need. Phew. Now you can boot the app. If you are on OSX or Linux use the following command.

DEBUG=express_example:* npm start

If you are on Windows use the following command.

set DEBUG=express_example:* & npm start

setup database configuration in 

node-order\routes\database.js file

I used mysql for the database and cus_order.sql is in this directory so please restore it

You should see Express server listening on port 3000 and if you open http://127.0.0.1:3000 you’ll see the default Express page.
